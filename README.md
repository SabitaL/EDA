Exploratory Data Anlysis 

EDA on Titanic dataset

Requirements:
Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook , Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Observations made:
More than 50% of the passengers died.
~50% of the passengers onboard Titanic are females.
There are relatively more passengers traveling in Class 3. Majority passengers embarked at port S.
There were many passengers who traveled alone.
The 'Fare' distribution clearly suggests more number of passengers traveling in Class 3. 
Young passengers are in majority.
Class 1 passengers had better survival rate than Class 2 or 3 indicating many passengers from Class 2,3 could not survive. We have seen that there are lot many passengers traveling in Class 3. Meaning, 'Pclass' has a role to play in passenger's survival chance.
The survival rate of men is ~ 20% and of women is ~ 75%. Therefore, 'Sex' plays an important role in predicting if the passenger is going to survive.
Parents accompanied by 0,1,2,3 children has better chance to survive. Majority of passengers are traveling alone and they had lesser chance to survive the disaster.
Passengers traveling with their siblings and spouse numbered up to 0,1,2 had a higher chance to survive. Meaning, passengers traveling alone were less prioritized.
Passengers Embarked=C seems to have had a higher survival rate whereas more number of passengers embarked at S.
Children had better chance of surviving.
Passengers who paid a higher fare had better survival rate.
Alternatively, Passengers with 'Pclass'=1 had better survival rate.
Women in the age range 20â€“50 had better survival rate. Men had relatively lower chance of surviving.
For 'Embarked'=C men had higher survival rate. 'Embarked' may not have direct correlation with 'Survived' as is seen in the graph below but there could be a correlation between 'Pclass' and 'Embarked' and then 'Pclass' and 'Survived'.
Many interesting observation can be made from correlation matrix like 'Age' negatively correlated with 'Pclass' and 'Pclass' negatively correlated with 'Fare'.

We can make our investigation even more rigorous and find more number of interesting patterns.

Suggestions are welcome.
